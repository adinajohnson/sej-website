  			Students for Energy Justice (SEJ), an Oberlin College student group, works to unite students and community members around resisting extreme energy extraction and defending community rights over corporate interests. Currently, we are working to fight hydraulic fracturing (fracking) throughout Ohio and prevent the construction of the Nexus Pipeline, a proposed pipeline which would carry natural gas from Kensington, OH to refineries in Ontario, Canada. As of recently, we have been working with community members across Northern Ohio to oppose the NEXUS pipeline. We have also joined efforts with the Ohio Community Rights Network to work on passing Community Bills of Rights across Ohio, which assert a communityâ€™s right to local self-governance and ban the development of extreme energy infrastructure.
